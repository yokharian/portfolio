üöÄ **Automating Customer Surveys**
In this project, we receive CSV files from **Medallia** with customer survey results üìù

**EventBridge** starts the **Step Function** flow that coordinates the execution of tasks üîÑ

**AWS Glue** extracts the information to **Amazon S3** and then integrates new records (deltas) and historical data to keep everything up to date and the processed information goes to **Redshift**

When the process finishes, the notification is sent via **SNS**, so the whole team knows that the data is ready üîî For added security, we use **Secret Manager**.
