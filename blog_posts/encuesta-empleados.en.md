üöÄ **Automating Data Flows with AWS**
I worked on a project where we processed files from an SFTP server to **AWS** for processing.

**AWS Glue** launches queries and **AWS Step Functions** orchestrates the entire process üîÑ at the end the information is integrated into **Redshift** and transferred to Redshift and notified with SNS when it is ready
