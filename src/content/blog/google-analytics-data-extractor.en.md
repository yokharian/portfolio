üìä **Innovation in Financial Lending**

At the fintech FairPlay, which provides loans to e-commerce customers, the need for fresh and reliable data about our clients was essential for making agile decisions and improving the accuracy of our financial services. To achieve this, I developed daily ETLs (Extract, Transform, Load) that allowed me to obtain data from Google Analytics v3 and subsequently update it to v4.

üîç **Data Extraction**

In the data extraction phase, I connected to the corresponding APIs using the appropriate parameters and managed the pagination of the results. It is important to highlight that throughout the development, I implemented various optimization strategies, such as:

- Splitting queries by calendar dates.
- Segmenting data into blocks.
- Adjusting parameters.
- Efficiently handling errors and retries.

These strategies allowed me to optimize processes and reduce the load on our systems.

‚öôÔ∏è **Adaptation to Changes**

Additionally, I had to face the differences between v3 and v4 of the Google Analytics API, which involved adapting the code and extraction strategies for each version. This effort enabled me to maintain the ability to obtain updated data, regardless of changes in the API.

The implementation of these solutions not only improved data quality but also facilitated informed decision-making, thereby driving innovation in our financial lending services.
