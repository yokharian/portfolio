Good morning Sofia

We would like to thank you for your participation in the validation project of the Black Belt Database Track 2022.

The result of the validation has been: approved.

Feedback:

-   It is important to demonstrate in a more structured and intentional way the benefits from the cost point of view (e.g.: on-premise or managed database vs serverless database)-   Good presentation of the database concepts (e.g.: structures, how to use each of the services)-   Good clarity in the access patterns-   Very good movement of data from DynamoDB to S3, through DynamoDB Streams, to consider analytics needs.-   We recommend that you manage your time better for future presentations
