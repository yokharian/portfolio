I implemented Git‚Äôs **credential helper** feature, which allows you to securely store and retrieve access credentials for Git repositories. ‚ú® This is especially useful when working with private repositories, as it avoids having to manually enter credentials every time you interact with the repository.

‚Äç
My solution helped more than **50 colleagues** with different operating systems (Mac, Windows, and Linux) access their repositories more efficiently.
‚Äç

With **Boto3**, the Python library for interacting with AWS services, I used it to connect to the AWS STS account and obtain a role with cross-account access to the AWS account where the Git repositories are located. This allows access to the repositories without needing direct credentials for that account.

‚Äç

Finally, the system **generates a QR code** üì± that can be scanned with a phone. This QR code contains the information needed to access the repositories. This solution benefited more than 50 coworkers, regardless of their operating system.
