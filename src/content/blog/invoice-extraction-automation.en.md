üîó **Integration with **[**SAT.ws**]()** using Python and FastAPI**
‚Äç

[**SAT.ws**]() is a cloud API that connects directly to the **Mexican Tax Administration Service (SAT)**, allowing you to automate the extraction of electronic invoices (CFDIs) without the need for manual access.

‚Äç
‚öôÔ∏è **Asynchronous Process**
‚Äç

The process is **asynchronous**: first, you make an initial request to [**SAT.ws**]() to extract the invoices. The platform processes this request in the background and does not immediately deliver the invoices. To avoid repetitive queries about the status of the process, **webhooks** can be used. By registering a webhook URL on [**SAT.ws**](), you will receive an automatic notification when the invoices are ready to be downloaded.

‚Äç

üì• **Final Request for Invoices**

**‚Äç**‚Äç

Once this notification is received, your application can make a second request to finally obtain the files (XML and PDF).

üöÄ **Benefits of FastAPI**
‚Äç

**FastAPI** is especially useful in this context, as it facilitates the handling of asynchronous operations between the SAT and your application. Its **SWAGGER** integration is very helpful and simplifies the configuration of endpoints to receive notifications via webhook. This integration makes the entire process **efficient** and **easy to implement**.
