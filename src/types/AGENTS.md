The **types** folder exists to centralize all `.d.ts` files.

- It stores type definitions that describe the actual `.ts` implementations.
- It includes **new contracts**: interfaces, types, abstract classes, and function signatures.
- It does not contain logic, only declarations.
- It improves organization, autocomplete, and early error detection in TypeScript.
