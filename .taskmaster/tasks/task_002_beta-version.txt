The language switcher functionality has been restored by re-integrating the `lang-bootstrap.js` and `lang-switcher.js` scripts (located in `/public/scripts/`) into the main `src/layouts/Layout.astro` file.

- **`lang-bootstrap.js`**: Inlined in the `<head>` to run before page render. It handles initial language detection by checking `localStorage` and `navigator.language`, redirecting to the appropriate path (`/` for EN, `/es/` for ES) to prevent content flashing.
- **`lang-switcher.js`**: Loaded as a standard script. It adds `click` and `keydown` event listeners to the switcher component in `src/components/Header.astro` (identified by `data-lang-switcher`). It manages navigation, updates `localStorage`, and toggles `aria-pressed` attributes for accessibility.

This implementation restores the full feature set, including persistence, automatic detection, and accessible keyboard navigation, leveraging the existing Tailwind CSS transition classes for smooth visual feedback.
