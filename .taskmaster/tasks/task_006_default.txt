# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Certifications Section
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the 'Certifications' section on the homepage that displays AWS certification badges.
# Details:
1. Design a visually appealing certifications section
2. Obtain official AWS certification badge images
3. Implement a responsive layout for displaying certification badges
4. Add metadata for each certification including:
   - Certification name
   - Date obtained
   - Verification link (if applicable)
5. Optimize badge images for web display
6. Implement hover effects for additional information
