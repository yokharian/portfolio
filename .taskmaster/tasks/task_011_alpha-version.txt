# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Animation and Interactive Elements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement subtle animations and interactive elements to enhance the user experience and create a premium feel.
# Details:
1. Implement subtle text animations as specified in the design considerations
2. Create hover effects for project cards (FR9)
3. Add transition animations for page navigation
4. Implement scroll-triggered animations for content sections
5. Create interactive elements for the Technologies Used tags
6. Implement smooth scrolling
7. Add focus states for accessibility
8. Ensure all animations respect user preferences (prefers-reduced-motion)

# Test Strategy:
Test all animations for smoothness and performance impact. Verify that animations don't trigger layout shifts. Test with prefers-reduced-motion enabled to ensure animations are disabled appropriately. Check accessibility of all interactive elements with keyboard navigation. Test on lower-end devices to ensure performance isn't compromised.
