# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations to ensure fast loading times and a high Lighthouse performance score.
# Details:
1. Implement image optimization pipeline:
   - Resize images to appropriate dimensions
   - Convert to modern formats (WebP with fallbacks)
   - Implement lazy loading for all images (FR19)
2. Set up CSS optimization:
   - Purge unused Tailwind CSS classes
   - Minify CSS output
3. Implement JavaScript optimization:
   - Minify and bundle JS files
   - Use defer for non-critical scripts
4. Implement font optimization:
   - Use font-display: swap
   - Preload critical fonts
5. Add appropriate caching headers
6. Implement critical CSS extraction
7. Set up code splitting where appropriate

# Test Strategy:
Use Lighthouse to measure performance score (target >90 as per SM5). Test site loading on slow network connections. Verify that lazy loading works correctly for images. Measure Time to First Byte (TTFB) and First Contentful Paint (FCP). Check total page weight and number of requests. Test on both desktop and mobile devices.
