# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Language Switching Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a complete language switching system that allows users to toggle between English and Spanish content throughout the site.
# Details:
1. Design a language switcher UI component
2. Implement a language state management system
3. Create a translation system that supports:
   - UI elements (navigation, buttons, etc.)
   - Static content on the homepage
   - Dynamic content from Markdown files
4. Store language preference in localStorage
5. Update URL with language parameter
6. Implement proper lang attribute on HTML elements
7. Ensure all date formats adapt to the selected language
8. Add language metadata to the page head

# Test Strategy:
Test language switching on all pages to verify content changes correctly. Verify that language preference is saved between sessions. Test URL-based language switching. Check that dates and other formatted content adapt to the selected language. Verify that the lang attribute is correctly updated in the HTML. Test with screen readers to ensure accessibility.
