# Task ID: 10
# Title: Finalize Build, Verify SEO, and Test Deployment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure the build process is fully functional, verify all SEO elements are preserved, conduct thorough end-to-end testing, and prepare for deployment.
# Details:
Run `npm run build` to generate the static site. Inspect the output `dist/` directory to ensure all assets (CSS, JS, images) are processed and optimized correctly. Use browser developer tools and online checkers to verify that SEO meta tags, JSON-LD scripts, and the sitemap (`/sitemap-index.xml`) are correctly generated. Perform a full regression test of the site on multiple browsers and devices. Update any deployment scripts or CI/CD configurations to use the new Astro build commands.

# Test Strategy:
Serve the build output locally using `npm run preview` and perform a final click-through of the entire site. Run a Lighthouse audit on key pages (homepage, blog post) to ensure performance and SEO scores are maintained or improved. Validate the generated sitemap using an online tool. Deploy to a staging environment and perform a final verification before pushing to production.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Generate Production Build and Verify Asset Integrity [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run the Astro production build command and inspect the output directory to ensure all static assets are correctly processed, minified, and placed.
### Details:
Execute `npm run build` in the terminal. After the build completes, navigate to the `dist/` directory. Verify that CSS and JS files are minified and have hash-based names for cache-busting. Check that images from `src/assets` are processed and that files from the `public/` directory are copied over correctly.

## 2. Validate SEO Meta Tags, JSON-LD, and Sitemap [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Serve the production build locally and use browser tools and online validators to confirm that all SEO-related elements are correctly generated and preserved.
### Details:
Run `npm run preview` to serve the `dist/` directory. Open the site in a browser and navigate to the homepage, a blog post page, and the projects page. Use the browser's developer tools (Elements and Network tabs) to inspect the `<head>` section. Verify that the `title`, `meta description`, `canonical` URL, Open Graph tags, and JSON-LD scripts generated by the `astro-seo` component are present and accurate. Locate the `dist/sitemap-index.xml` and its referenced sub-sitemaps, and validate them using an online sitemap validator.

## 3. Conduct Cross-Browser and Responsive End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Perform a full manual regression test on the locally served production build across different browsers and device sizes to catch any rendering or functionality issues.
### Details:
With the site running via `npm run preview`, perform a thorough click-through of the entire website. Test all navigation links, interactive elements, and page layouts. Perform this testing on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Use the browser's responsive design mode to simulate and test on common mobile, tablet, and desktop viewport sizes.

## 4. Run Lighthouse Audits for Performance and Accessibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Use Google Lighthouse to audit key pages of the production build, ensuring high scores are maintained for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.
### Details:
While serving the site with `npm run preview`, open Chrome DevTools. Navigate to the 'Lighthouse' tab. Run a full audit (all categories) on the homepage and at least one content-heavy page, like a blog post. Analyze the report and identify any major regressions or areas for improvement.

## 5. Update Deployment Platform Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Configure the deployment service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Actions) to use the correct Astro build commands and settings for continuous deployment.
### Details:
Access your deployment platform's settings for this project. Update the 'Build Command' to `npm run build` or `astro build`. Set the 'Publish Directory' (or 'Output Directory') to `dist`. Ensure the Node.js version is set to a compatible version (e.g., 18.x or higher). If a `netlify.toml` or similar configuration file is preferred, create or update it with these settings.
