# Task ID: 4
# Title: Design and Implement Homepage Hero Section
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the hero section for the homepage that highlights Sofia's specialization in Python and AWS, with a professional profile image.
# Details:
1. Design a visually appealing hero section with:
   - Professional headline emphasizing Python and AWS expertise
   - Professional profile image
   - Brief introduction text
   - Primary CTA button
2. Implement responsive layout for the hero section
3. Add subtle text animations as specified in the design considerations
4. Optimize the profile image for web display
5. Ensure the section is visually prominent and captures attention
6. Implement proper heading hierarchy for SEO
7. Create both English and Spanish versions of the content

# Test Strategy:
Test the hero section across different screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior. Verify that text animations work correctly and don't affect usability. Check image loading performance and ensure proper alt text for accessibility. Test with both language settings to verify content switching works correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Scaffold Hero Section Markup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic HTML structure for the hero section in the homepage template using Nunjucks templating.
### Details:
Add the hero section markup to src/pages/index.njk, extending from base.njk. Include the following elements: a container div with appropriate Tailwind classes, heading (h1) for the professional title, subheading paragraph for the brief introduction, a placeholder for the profile image, and a primary CTA button. Use semantic HTML elements and ensure proper nesting structure. Add data attributes for future animation targets.

## 2. Implement Responsive Hero Layout with Tailwind [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Style the hero section using Tailwind CSS to create a responsive layout that works well on all device sizes.
### Details:
Apply Tailwind classes to create a mobile-first responsive layout: stack elements vertically on mobile, switch to side-by-side layout on lg+ screens. Use flex or grid for layout. Apply appropriate spacing, padding, and max-width constraints. Implement a container with mx-auto for centering. Style the CTA button with appropriate colors, padding, and hover states. Ensure the hero section has sufficient visual prominence through background styling, padding, and possibly a subtle gradient or accent color.

## 3. Add and Optimize Profile Image [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Add the professional profile image to the hero section with proper optimization for web performance.
### Details:
Place the profile image file in public/assets/images/profile.jpg. Optimize the image for web (compress, proper dimensions). Create multiple sizes for responsive images if needed. In the markup, add the image with proper alt text, explicit width/height attributes to prevent layout shift, and appropriate Tailwind classes for sizing and styling. Consider adding a subtle border or shadow effect. Do not add lazy-loading to this image since it's likely an LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) element.

## 4. Implement Text Animation with Accessibility Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Add subtle text animations to the hero section while ensuring accessibility compliance.
### Details:
Implement subtle fade-in and/or slide-in animations for the heading, subheading, and CTA using CSS transitions or animations. Add a small stagger effect between elements. Ensure animations are short (300-500ms) and don't interfere with readability. Implement prefers-reduced-motion media query support to disable animations for users who prefer reduced motion. Use data attributes from the markup as animation hooks. Ensure no layout shifts occur during animations.

## 5. Implement Internationalization for Hero Content [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create both English and Spanish versions of the hero section content and implement language switching.
### Details:
Create a JSON data file with English and Spanish translations for all hero section text content (heading, subheading, CTA button text). Use the existing normalizeLang utility and language filters to implement content switching. Update the hero section markup to use translation keys instead of hardcoded text. Ensure the language switch mechanism works correctly for the hero section. Verify that text length differences between languages don't break the layout.

## 6. Optimize Hero Section for SEO and Accessibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5
### Description: Ensure the hero section follows SEO best practices and meets WCAG AA accessibility standards.
### Details:
Verify proper heading hierarchy with h1 for the main headline. Add appropriate ARIA attributes where needed. Ensure sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text) according to WCAG AA standards. Check that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible with visible focus states. Add structured data (JSON-LD) for the person information if appropriate. Ensure the CTA button has descriptive text and proper focus styling.

## 7. Create Build Verification and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6
### Description: Implement verification checks for the hero section and update documentation.
### Details:
Create a simple smoke test that verifies the hero section renders correctly in the built output (_site directory). Add comments in the code explaining the structure and animation approach. Update any project documentation to include information about the hero section implementation. Document the translation keys used for i18n. Create a simple checklist for content updates to the hero section. Verify that the Eleventy build process completes successfully with the new hero section.
