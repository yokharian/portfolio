# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Featured Work Section
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the 'Featured Work' section on the homepage that displays the most important projects in a card-based layout.
# Details:
1. Design project cards that include:
   - Project thumbnail image
   - Project title
   - Brief description
   - Technologies used (tags)
   - Visual hover effect (FR9)
2. Implement a responsive grid layout that shows:
   - 3 columns on desktop
   - 2 columns on tablet
   - 1 column on mobile
3. Create a system to mark certain projects as 'featured' in the frontmatter
4. Implement lazy loading for project images (FR19)
5. Add smooth transitions for hover effects
6. Ensure proper linking to individual project pages

# Test Strategy:
Test the grid layout at various screen sizes to verify the correct number of columns. Verify that hover effects work properly and are accessible. Test image lazy loading by simulating slow network conditions. Check that all links to project pages work correctly. Verify the section renders correctly with different numbers of featured projects.
