# Overview
This project aims to migrate the existing Eleventy-based portfolio website from JavaScript to TypeScript. The portfolio currently uses 11ty with Tailwind CSS and contains utility functions for internationalization, content management, date formatting, and markdown processing. The migration will improve code maintainability, catch type-related bugs early, and provide better developer experience through enhanced IDE support and autocompletion.

# Current Architecture Analysis
The project consists of:
- Eleventy configuration (.eleventy.js)
- Utility modules in src/utils/ (9 JS files)
- Data configuration files (site.js, site.json, i18n.json, certifications.json)
- Client-side JavaScript in public/assets/js/
- Test scripts in scripts/ directory
- Build configuration (tailwind.config.js, package.json scripts)

# Core Features to Implement
## 1. TypeScript Configuration Setup
- Add TypeScript compiler configuration (tsconfig.json)
- Configure build process to handle TypeScript compilation
- Set up type checking integration with existing npm scripts
- Configure Eleventy to work with TypeScript files

## 2. Utility Functions Migration
- Convert all utility files in src/utils/ to TypeScript
- Add proper type definitions for i18n, dates, format, content processing
- Create interfaces for data structures used across utilities
- Implement generic types for language handling and content filtering

## 3. Configuration Files Migration
- Convert .eleventy.js to TypeScript
- Migrate site.js data file to TypeScript with proper typing
- Add type definitions for JSON data files (i18n.json, certifications.json)
- Create TypeScript interfaces for frontmatter schemas

## 4. Client-Side JavaScript Migration
- Convert client-side scripts to TypeScript
- Add DOM type definitions and event handling types
- Implement proper type safety for browser-specific code

## 5. Build Process Integration
- Update npm scripts to include TypeScript compilation
- Configure Tailwind CSS to work with TypeScript files
- Set up incremental compilation for development workflow
- Integrate TypeScript checking into test suite

# Technical Architecture
## Type System Design
- Create shared type definitions in a types/ directory
- Define interfaces for:
  - Project metadata and frontmatter
  - Internationalization keys and values  
  - Date formatting options
  - Content filtering and processing
  - Eleventy collection items

## Module Structure
- Maintain existing file structure while adding .ts extensions
- Use ES6 modules with proper TypeScript imports/exports
- Implement strict type checking where beneficial
- Allow gradual migration with mixed JS/TS support initially

## Build Pipeline
- TypeScript compilation before Eleventy build
- Source map generation for debugging
- Type checking as part of CI/CD process
- Hot reload support for development

# Development Roadmap
## Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- Install TypeScript and related dependencies
- Create tsconfig.json with appropriate compiler options
- Set up basic build process integration
- Create initial type definition files

## Phase 2: Utility Functions Migration
- Convert core utility functions (dates, format, i18n)
- Add comprehensive type definitions
- Ensure backward compatibility during transition
- Update tests to work with TypeScript

## Phase 3: Configuration and Build Files
- Migrate Eleventy configuration to TypeScript
- Convert build scripts and configuration files
- Update package.json scripts for TypeScript workflow
- Test full build process with TypeScript

## Phase 4: Client-Side and Advanced Features
- Convert browser-side JavaScript to TypeScript
- Add advanced type checking and strict mode
- Implement generic types for enhanced reusability
- Performance optimization and final testing

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **TypeScript Setup** - Must be completed first to enable subsequent conversions
2. **Utility Functions** - Core functionality used throughout the project
3. **Data Structures** - Type definitions needed by other modules
4. **Configuration Files** - Build system components that tie everything together
5. **Client-Side Code** - Independent of server-side code, can be done in parallel
6. **Testing and Optimization** - Final validation and performance improvements

# User Experience Considerations
- Zero impact on end users (internal refactoring only)
- Improved developer experience through:
  - Better IDE autocompletion and error detection
  - Enhanced refactoring capabilities
  - More reliable code through type safety
- Maintained hot reload and development workflow efficiency

# Risks and Mitigations
## Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: Eleventy TypeScript integration complexity
- **Mitigation**: Use proven community solutions and incremental migration approach

## Compatibility Issues
- **Risk**: Breaking changes in existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and gradual migration strategy

## Development Workflow Disruption
- **Risk**: Slower build times with TypeScript compilation
- **Mitigation**: Incremental compilation and parallel processing setup

# Success Criteria
- All JavaScript files successfully converted to TypeScript
- Full type coverage with minimal 'any' types
- All existing functionality preserved and tested
- Development workflow maintained or improved
- Build process stable and performant

# Appendix
## Dependencies to Add
- typescript
- @types/node
- ts-node (for development)
- Additional @types packages as needed

## Configuration Files to Create
- tsconfig.json
- Type definition files (.d.ts)
- Updated package.json scripts

## Migration Strategy
- Gradual file-by-file conversion
- Maintain JavaScript compatibility during transition
- Comprehensive testing at each stage
- Documentation updates for new TypeScript patterns
