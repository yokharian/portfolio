## Visual Description

The page is a personal portfolio with a clean, modern design, using a neutral color palette with accents in a brand color (brand-600). The structure is vertical, divided into clear sections that guide the user through the information.

- **Header**: At the top, there is a simple header with the person's name (‘Sofia Escobedo’) in bold and a call-to-action button (‘Book a 30 min call’) aligned to the right. There is no traditional navigation menu, suggesting a focus on simplicity and direct action.

- **Hero Section**: Immediately below the header is a prominent hero section. It features a large, eye-catching title highlighting the specialization (‘Specialist in AWS and Python with 4 years of work experience’), a concise description, and a call-to-action button similar to the one in the header. On the right is a circular image of the developer, adding a personal and visual touch.

- **Featured Work / Highlighted Projects Section**: This section showcases featured projects in a card format. Each card includes a background image, a title, a brief description, and a link. The cards are arranged in a responsive grid, allowing for efficient viewing of multiple projects.

- **Experience / Real Life Projects Section**: Similar to the previous section, this area also presents projects in a card grid format. The main difference is the content and emphasis on ‘real-life projects’.

- **Certifications Section**: A section dedicated to certifications, specifically those from AWS. It displays a series of certification badge images arranged in a grid, visually reinforcing the developer's credentials. The background of this section is slightly different (light gray) to distinguish it.

- **Footer**: At the bottom of the page, a simple footer contains the person's name, a set of social media icons (represented by colored squares with letters), and a copyright notice.
